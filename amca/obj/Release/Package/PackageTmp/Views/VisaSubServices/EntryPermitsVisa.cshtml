                            <p>Visitors to the UAE with different purposes now have the option of applying for ten different types of entry visas without the need for a host or sponsor.</p>
                            <p>UAE visitors can choose from several types of visas under the new system. Introducing new permits will also eliminate the need for a host or sponsor.</p>
                            <p>Entry visas have undergone significant improvements, such as facilitating entry requirements for all visa types and offering flexible visa durations to meet visitors' needs and their purpose for visiting. In addition, all entry visas will now be valid for 60 days from the date of issuance and will be available for single or multiple entries. In addition, they can be renewed for similar periods.</p>
                            <h3>Job exploration entry visa</h3>
                            <p>Designed to attract young talents and skilled professionals to explore job opportunities in the country, the Job Exploration Visa is mainly intended to attract such people.

                            <p>To make the process easier for tourists and visitors, the new multiple-entry tourist visa can now be granted to all nationalities. On each visit, tourists can stay in the country for 90 days on a five-year visa, which is extendable for another 90 days.</p>
