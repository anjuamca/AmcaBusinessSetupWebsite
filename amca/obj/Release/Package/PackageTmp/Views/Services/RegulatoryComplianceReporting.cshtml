                            <p>Regardless of sector or scale, all companies must obey the laws and regulations of the country’s operations. Regulatory compliance and reporting have to do with a set of guidelines that an organization must follow in accordance with the law. This is considered one of a compliance officer's most critical responsibilities–including reports on corporate compliance.</p>
                            <p>The compliance report documents show a company's adherence to specific business regulations. In addition, some government sectors and agencies in the UAE inspect and ensure that a company's enforcement is in accordance with its corporate goals, risk management plans, and the country's laws and regulations.</p>
                            <p>The regulatory compliance and reporting in the UAE ensure that all companies uphold all the country's laws and regulations - no one is excluded. </p>

                            <h3>Economic Substance Regulations (ESR)</h3>
                            <p>The Economic Substance Regulations are enacted in accordance with the global norm established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") Forum on Harmful Tax Practices, which allows companies engaging in geographically mobile business activities to have significant operations in a jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>According to the Economic Substance Regulations, ESR notifications must be submitted within six months of the Licensee's financial year-end.</p>
                            <p>Within twelve months of the end of the financial year, all ESR Reports must be submitted.</p>

                            <h3><strong>Country-by-Country Reporting ("CbCR")</strong></h3>
                            <p>The guidelines for Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) are based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) CbCR guidance. It is intended for UAE-based companies that are part of multinational groups that are tax residents in different jurisdictions and have combined sales of at least 3,150,000,000 UAE Dirhams in the previous financial year.</p>
                            <p>The CbC report should be sent within 12 months of the end of the MNE Group's reporting year.</p>

                            <p>The Ultimate Beneficial Owner's (UBO) goals include keeping the UAE's economic status in line with international standards. Its purpose is to create an effective regulatory structure and procedure for beneficial owner data and regulate minimum obligations in the disclosure of Beneficial Owners, Shareholders, Partners, and Nominee Board Members.</p>

                            <p>The UAE's Ministry of Economy (MoE) has launched an awareness and monitoring campaign to enable registered Designated Non-Financial Business and Professions (DNFBPs) to register with the Financial Intelligent Unit (goAML) system. Similarly, it encourages targeted organizations to write in the Committee on Goods Subject to Import and Export Control (Automatic Reporting System for Sanctions Lists) system and to take steps in accordance with both the provisions of Federal Law No. 20 of 2018 on the fight against money laundering crimes and the financing of terrorism and criminal organizations, as well as relevant laws and decisions.</p>
                            <p>The grace period for organizations to enforce these measures has been extended until March 31, 2021. Non-compliance with the above conditions would result in the suspension of your business license, as directed by the Ministry of Economy.</p>

                                    <p>In the United Arab Emirates, determining whether or not a company complies with the country's laws and regulations is extremely difficult. As a result, there have been occasions when management assumed that the organization had already adhered to a specific rule, only to find out later that they had incurred a penalty or punishment.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Lack of Enough Time and Resources for Training</strong>
                                    <p>Every day, new laws and regulations are enacted that organizations in the UAE must obey. As a result, organizations must dedicate a considerable amount of time and resources to keeping their bodies up to date, through at least a training, on the current laws and regulations in the UAE, which tend to be updated regularly.</p>
                                </li>
