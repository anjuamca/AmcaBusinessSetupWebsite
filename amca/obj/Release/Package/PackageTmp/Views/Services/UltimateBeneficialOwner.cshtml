                            <p>
                                The United Arab of Emirates replaced Cabinet Resolution No. 34 of 2020 with Cabinet Resolution No. (58) of 2020 regulating Beneficial Owner Procedures (the “Resolution”).
                            </p>
                            <p>The Resolution covers the most updated requirements for the entities in UAE to disclose their Real beneficiaries or Ultimate Beneficial Owners, which intends to enhance the transparency of the UAE-registered entities. Similarly, it intends to improve compliance and global confidence in international data by developing effective and sustainable executive and regulatory mechanisms.</p>
                            <p>The Ultimate Beneficial Owner’s (UBO’s) objectives cover the maintenance of the economic position of UAE with international requirements. It also aims to regulate minimum obligations in disclosure of Beneficial Owners, Shareholders, Partners, and Nominee Board Members, and lastly, establish an effective regulatory mechanism and procedure for the beneficial owner data. In addition, it aims to control Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.</p>
                            <p>As per Ministry, 513000, regulated by 38 licensing authorities, are required to provide data on ultimate beneficial owners. Including all Licensed by the local licensing authorities and the non-financial free zones.</p>


                            <h2>How to Identify Ultimate Beneficial Owner?</h2>
                            <p><em>Ultimate Beneficial Owner Rule</em></p>
                            <p>As per Cabinet Resolution No. (58) of 2020, Beneficial Owner or Real Beneficiaries can be the following:</p>
                            <h3>For UBO:</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Natural Person who owns/controls the establishment definitively, through direct/indirect ownership shares of 25 % or more.</li>
                                <li>Or: someone who holds the right to vote by 25% or more or the right to appoint/dismiss the majority of the establishment’s managers or any other means by which he exercises ultimate control over the establishment.</li>
                                <li>In cases where UBO cannot be identified through the two conditions above, then a natural person who holds the position of Senior Management Official in the company may be deemed as the UBO. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>On the other hand, there are entities exempted from this resolution. They are as follows: (a) the companies in economic free zones like Abu Dhabi Gold Markets and Dubai International Financial Centre, and (b) the companies directly or indirectly owned or affiliated by the Federal or Emirate Government. </p>
                            <p>Entities must assess who constitutes a UBO and consider whether anyone is a nominee Director / Manager. The Register of Shareholders / Partners is not a new concept. The Thirequirement isn't outlined in the UAE Commercial Companies Law and Free Zone Companies Regulations. The Resolution requires additional information about voting rights.</p>
                            <p>For Nominee Director/Manager:</p>
                            <p>
                                The details of the Director / Manager, acting in agreement with the instructions of another person.

                            </p>
                            <p>A UBO is any individual who controls 25% or more of the partnership's capital or who ultimately is entitled to control 25% or more of the voting rights of the partnership.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, some entities are exempted from this resolution. They are as follows: (a) the companies in economic free zones like Abu Dhabi Gold Markets and Dubai International Financial Centre, and (b) the companies directly or indirectly owned by the Federal or Emirate Government.</p>
                            <p>Entities must assess who constitutes a UBO and consider whether anyone is a nominee Director / Manager. The Register of Shareholders / Partners is not a new concept, as this requirement is outlined in the UAE Commercial Companies Law and respective Free Zone Companies Regulations. However, the Resolution requires additional information to be detailed (for example, voting rights).</p>
